Create the project how you want it to look after generating a project based on that archetype.

Run:
	mvn archetype:create-from-project

Move /target/archetype somewhere and rename the directory to the name of the artifactId you wish to use.

Fix any files that may be broken (Specifically, the import statements and possibly names in the .pom file may not be variables where they should be.)

Place the archetype in your local repo (optional):
	
	mvn clean install

Deploy artifacts to local repo in specified location:

	mvn -DaltDeploymentRepository=repo::default::file:D:\Dropbox\Git\mavenrepo\releases clean deploy

Generate the catalog file for the local repo:

	mvn archetype:crawl -DcatalogFile=D:\Dropbox\Git\mavenrepo\releases -Drepository=D:\Dropbox\Git\mavenrepo\releases

Don't forgot to push the changes to github.
